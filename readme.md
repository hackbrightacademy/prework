Hackbright Prework
==================

Premise
-------
You can enter Hackbright with no technical experience at all and do well, but it is certainly advantageous to devote as much time as possible to peparing for the fellowship. We divide the skills needed in engineering into two categories: mechanical and conceptual. The mechanical skills are easiest to acquire in individual study, and these are the ones we encourage you to spend time on.

Unfortunately, these skills are also probably the least exciting ones to work on, as they are not obviously or immediately applicable towards building something interesting. However, they are *foundational*, and having them will help you get the most out of Hackbright.

Goals
-----
The first mechanical skill you should work on is memorizing syntax. Committing syntax to memory is an act of rote memorization and requires little more than repetition and time. This will have the single biggest impact on your ability to acquire new programming concepts and should be your primary goal prior to Hackbright.

Specifics
---------

###Learning the Python Language

Working from the digital version of [How to Think Like A Computer Scientist](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/toc.html), the following are the most important chapters. Finish these and the rest of the prework, and then feel free to continue with the remaining chapters for bonus points.

* [Simple Python Data](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/toc.html#simple-python-data)
* [Strings](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/toc.html#strings)
* [Lists](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/toc.html#lists)
* [Selection](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/toc.html#selection)
* [Python Turtle Graphics](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/toc.html#python-turtle-graphics)
* [Functions](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/toc.html#functions)

Completion here means successfully answering all the exercises at the end of each chapter. Because the goal is memorization, you should plan on doing each problem set several times. As you do each problem, it is recommend that you record the time it takes to complete each task. You aren't shooting for any particular time, only that you are faster when you repeat the problem set.

Depending on your learning style, it can be helpful to read the exercises first, take notes on vocabulary that is unfamiliar to you, then go back and read the chapter looking for definitions.

As you read through the chapters, make sure you keep an eye out for these specific concepts.

* Creating variables containing different data types
    * Integers
    * Floats
    * Strings
* Creating and manipulating lists
    * Adding an item to a list
    * Accessing data in a list
    * Removing data from a list
* Writing an if-elif-else block
* Writing a for-loop
* Writing a while loop
* Creating a function

###Learning HTML and CSS

You may think that learning HTML and CSS is not as leet (1337 or *elite*) as learning Python, but its another fundamental foundational skill that you **should. not. be. without**. If you don't know any HTML or CSS, this section is very important. If you've dabbled in it, it will give you a thorough overview and is therefore very important. Only if you are positively adept should you think about skipping this, but going through it wont take that long so you should do it anyway because it's *very important*. We think that the best, free-est and progress-track-iest version is over here, at Codecademy:

Please finish the whole track. We will be teaching HTML and CSS during the course, but, yet again, having some experience with the mechanics will help you to learn more during the fellowship.


Assessment
----------
In addition to the chapter exercises, we have a series of translation drills (English to Python and back) to help you determine your progress and assess which tasks you need to spend more time practicing.

Good luck, get as much done as you can, and we are looking forward to seeing you soon.
